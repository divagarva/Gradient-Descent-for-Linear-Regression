# Gradient-Descent-for-Linear-Regression
 This project implements gradient descent to perform linear regression, demonstrating how the algorithm minimizes the cost function by iteratively updating model parameters. It includes generating data, defining a cost function, applying gradient descent, and visualizing the fitted line and cost convergence.
